# Simon Says - A Responsive Web Game

A modern, responsive implementation of the classic "Simon Says" memory game. This project was built from scratch with a focus on clean JavaScript game logic, a mobile-first layout using the Bootstrap 5 grid, and persistent high-score tracking via browser `localStorage`.

## Features

- **Classic Simon Gameplay:** Follow the progressively longer and faster color sequences to test your memory.
- **Fully Responsive Design:** The 2x2 game board and UI adapt perfectly to all screen sizes, from small mobile phones to large desktops, using Bootstrap's grid system.
- **Persistent High-Score:** Your highest score is automatically saved in the browser using the `localStorage` API, so you can always come back and try to beat your record.
- **Interactive UI:** A clear "Start Game" button, distinct flash effects for the computer's sequence and the user's input, and an instant "Game Over" screen.
